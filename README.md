# gap-automated-tests

Automated test repository for Grant Application Portal - Find a Grant.

The E2E tests are built using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress).

There are example tests contained at `cypress/e2e/_examples` to use as a guide when writing tests.

## Getting Started

To install dependencies, run `npm install`

## Running tests

To run the tests, run `npm run cypress:open` - this will open a window that will allow you to select your browser, then select test files to run.
